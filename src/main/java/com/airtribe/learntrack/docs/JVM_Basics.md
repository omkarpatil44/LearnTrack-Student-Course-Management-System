JDK
Java Development Toolkit :
Its a complete set consisit of JVM , JRE + Developement toolkit , Needed to develop Java applications.
It conatins JRE+JVM, Compiler (Javac),Debugger()jdb,Tools (javadoc,jar)
JVM -> Runs Java

Java Runtime Enviornment :
It consist of JVM + Java Libraries like core labraries like (java.lang, java.util)
Users who only run Java apps
JRE -> Runs + Libraries

Java Virtual Machine : 
JVM is Virtual machine that runs Java programs.It executes bytecode .class files.
Managed memory,Heap & stack. Handles Garbage collection, Makes java Platform independent

Bytecode :It is an intermediate code generated by the Java compiler that allows Java programs to run on any platform.
The Java program (.java file) is converted into the Java compiler (javac) converts it into bytecode (.class file).
This bytecode is not machine code and not human-readable.

Write once, run anywhere:
Basicly its a term that once code is written and compile once it can run on any platform.
When we compile the java code the .java file gets converted into .class bytecode file.
Then the specific JVM installed as per Operating systems (Platform independent) convert the byte code into 
machine code.

Java Code -> Bytecode -> JVM -> Output
